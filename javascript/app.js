// i = 1... checks again.. its true... increments,,, does code again
// console.log(questions[i]);
// set up question{ div in html... then set up question[0].question to the text or innerthtml or w.e.
// make the buttons' innertext or html as the questions[0].choices. choices is an array, so you will have to loop over it 
// and when you loop over it you'll change the text of each choice button on the html
